# Expressions and operators

*Expressions are a well-founded set of expressions and variables that values to a particular value known as expression. This specific value can be identified as a number, logical value, or string. The expression x=7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. the expression evaluates to 7.*

## Loops

Loops are a function that tells the computer how to do something. Like to tell someone to take an x amount of steps in one direction and then y amount of steps in another. this is an excellent example, such as "go ten steps to the right." which could be seen as a loop. Loops are the repetition statements constantly running until the condition becomes false or there isn't anything else to loop. The "for loop" carries out a chunk of code only if the particular condition is proper. "While Loop" makes a loop that carries out a specific condition considering it evaluates to be true. "Do-while-loop" makes a loop that carries out a particular condition, considering it is false.
